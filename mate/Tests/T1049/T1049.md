# T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1049)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network. 

===Windows===

Utilities and commands that acquire this information include netstat, "net use," and "net session" with Net.

===Mac and Linux ===

In Mac and Linux, <code>netstat</code> and <code>lsof</code> can be used to list current connections. <code>who -a</code> and <code>w</code> can be used to show which users are currently logged in, similar to "net session".

Detection: System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.

Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.

Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

Data Sources: Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring

Permissions Required: User, Administrator</blockquote>
