display_name: System Time Discovery
tactic: Discovery
description: The system time is set and stored by the Windows Time Service within a domain to maintain time synchronization between systems and services in an enterprise network. An adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone from a local or remote system. This information may be gathered in a number of ways, such as with Net on Windows by performing net time \\hostname to gather the system time on a remote system. The victim's time zone may also be inferred from the current system time or gathered by using w32tm /tz.
