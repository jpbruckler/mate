# T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1033)
<blockquote>===Windows===

Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system. They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using Credential Dumping. The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs.

===Mac===

On Mac, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>users</code>,<code>w</code>, and <code>who</code>.

===Linux===

On Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>.

Detection: System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.

Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.

Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

Data Sources: File monitoring, Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters

Permissions Required: User, Administrator</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - System Owner/User Discovery
Identify System owner or users on an endpoint

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| computer_name | Name of remote computer | string | computer1|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!
```
cmd.exe /C whoami
wmic useraccount get /ALL
quser /SERVER:"#{computer_name}"
quser
qwinsta.exe" /server:#{computer_name}
qwinsta.exe
for /F "tokens=1,2" %i in ('qwinsta /server:#{computer_name} ^| findstr "Active Disc"') do @echo %i | find /v "#" | find /v "console" || echo %j > usernames.txt
@FOR /F %n in (computers.txt) DO @FOR /F "tokens=1,2" %i in ('qwinsta /server:%n ^| findstr "Active Disc"') do @echo %i | find /v "#" | find /v "console" || echo %j > usernames.txt
```
