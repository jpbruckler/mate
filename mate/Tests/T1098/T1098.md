# T1098 - Account Manipulation
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1098)
<blockquote>Account manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.

Detection: Collect events that correlate with changes to account objects on systems and the domain, such as event ID 4738. (Citation: Microsoft User Modified Event) Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ (Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017) or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password. (Citation: GitHub Mimikatz Issue 92 June 2017)

Use of credentials may also occur at unusual times or to unusual systems or services and may correlate with other suspicious activity.

Platforms: Windows

Data Sources: Authentication logs, API monitoring, Windows event logs, Packet capture

Permissions Required: Administrator</blockquote>
