# T1035 - Service Execution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1035)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute a binary, command, or script via a method that interacts with Windows services, such as the Service Control Manager. This can be done by either creating a new service or modifying an existing service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with New Service and Modify Existing Service during service persistence or privilege escalation.

Detection: Changes to service Registry entries and command-line invocation of tools capable of modifying services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., may be suspicious. If a service is used only to execute a binary or script and not to persist, then it will likely be changed back to its original form shortly after the service is restarted so the service is not left broken, as is the case with the common administrator tool PsExec.

Platforms: Windows

Data Sources: Windows Registry, Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring

Permissions Required: Administrator, SYSTEM

Remote Support: Yes</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Command as a Service
Creates a service specifying an aribrary command and executes it. When executing commands such as PowerShell, the service will report that it did not start correctly even when code executes properly. 

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| service_name | Name of service to create | string | ARTService|
| executable_command | Command to execute as a service | string | %COMSPEC% /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -command New-Item -ItemType File C:rt-marker.txt|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!
```
sc.exe create #{service_name} binPath= #{executable_command}
sc.exe start #{service_name}
sc.exe delete #{service_name}
```
