# T1115 - Clipboard Data
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1115)
<blockquote>Adversaries may collect data stored in the Windows clipboard from users copying information within or between applications. 

===Windows===

Applications can access clipboard data by using the Windows API. (Citation: MSDN Clipboard) 

===Mac===

OSX provides a native command, <code>pbpaste</code>, to grab clipboard contents  (Citation: Operating with EmPyre).

Detection: Access to the clipboard is a legitimate function of many applications on a Windows system. If an organization chooses to monitor for this behavior, then the data will likely need to be correlated against other suspicious or non-user-driven activity.

Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

Data Sources: API monitoring</blockquote>
